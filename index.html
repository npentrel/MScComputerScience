                                British withdrawal from the European Union (also referred to as Brexit - a British exit from the 28-nation EU) is a political goal that has been pursued by various individuals, advocacy groups, and political parties from across the political spectrum since the United Kingdom (UK) joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973. In 1975, a referendum was held on the country's continued membership of the EEC, which was approved by 67% of voters. The EEC later transformed into the European Union (EU). In 2016, a referendum arranged by the UK Parliament was held on the country's membership of the EU. The referendum was set to take place on June 23rd, 2016.

                                The economist shared some important insights: There are several demographics that visibly influence voting intentions. Such factors include the political opinions of the voter, the region the voter is from, the voter's gender, the voter's economic standing, as well as the voter's age. Among these demographics voting intentions remained fairly constant over the period of two months but the influence of some of the demographics is striking. Thus it shows that overall the younger generation favors remaining in the EU with a large margin while we see the reverse trend with the older generation. Similarly people in administrative, managerial, or professional positions favor remaining, while skilled and unskilled manual laborers and unemployed people largely favor leaving. There is little difference in voting intentions between the genders.

                                Vote Leave is the campaign for a 'leave'-vote in the EU Referendum that will take place on the 23rd June 2016. Their campaign page reads that technological and economic forces are changing the world fast and that EU institutions cannot cope with this development. They follow that the UK has lost control of vital policies which is damaging. They stat that they see a need for a new relationship. In case of a 'leave' vote, they suggest the UK should negotiate a new UK-EU deal based on free trade and friendly cooperation. In addition the UK should end the supremacy of EU law and thus regain control. Thus they say the UK will stop sending £350 million every week to Brussels and instead spend it on other priorities, like the NHS and science research. They state that through a 'leave'-vote, the UK will regain their seats on international institutions like the World Trade Organisation which will make the UK a more influential force for free trade and international cooperation.

                                The Remain campaign is the campaign for a 'remain'-vote in the EU Referendum that will take place on the 23rd June 2016. They state that "we are stronger, better off and safer in Europe than we would be out on our own." As key benefits they list more jobs, lower prices on food and fuel, and worker's rights. According to them a 'remain' vote will help to protect jobs, lower prices, workers' rights and lead to a a stronger, safer and better off Britain. In addition the campaign claims that being able to trade freely across the EU helps UK businesses grow and create jobs, giving you and your family more opportunities & more financial security. Furthermore they state that 9/10 economic experts predict economic damage in case of a 'leave'-vote. The Bank of England takes this further and says that there would be an economic shock, and the UK could go back into recession. Remaining in the EU will, accord to the Remain campaign, make the economy stronger and help public services including the NHS.

                                The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting. It was the highest turnout in a UK-wide vote since the 1992 general election. England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. The UK is now expected to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. After Cameron stepped down in the aftermath of the outcome of the referendum, his successor now needs to decide when to invoke this. Invoking Article 50 will then set in motion the formal legal process of withdrawing from the EU, and give the UK two years to negotiate its withdrawal.

                        <p class="medium">
                        The pound has fallen to its lowest level in more than 30 years against the dollar, following the UK's vote to leave the European Union. The UK imported more than $625bn (£474bn) of goods and services in 2015; mainly from Germany, China, the Netherlands, the United States and France. A falling pound means that these imports will become more expensive - leading to price rises on the High Street. "The weak pound will have an impact on prices, especially clothing and electricals, where the majority is imported from abroad," says retail analyst Maureen Hinton of Verdict Retail. But this won't happen immediately as retailers buy the foreign currency they need to pay for their imports in advance, she says. The weaker pound is "probably not going to hit prices until later in the year".

                    <h4>Aftermath Brexit Vote</h4>
                        <p class="medium">
                            Mr Cameron resigned as Prime Minister shortly after 8am, announcing that he thinks Britain should have a new Prime Minister in place by the start of the Conservative conference in October.  He will leave the task of triggering Article 50 to his successor. The EU's leadership has demanded Britain activate Article 50 exit talks "as soon as possible" as they attempt to end the uncertainty over the bloc, "however painful that process may be".  "Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty. We have rules to deal with this in an orderly way. Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union sets out the procedure to be followed if a Member State decides to leave the European Union," the official statement said.
