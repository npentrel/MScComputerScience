Thank you for choosing to participate in this study on Navigation Preference in Storytelling. Please listen carefully to these instructions. You will shortly receive a link to the presentation you will be viewing today. This is not an ordinary presentation. Instead it will allow you to choose your own path through the presentation.

Once you open the presentation you will see the first slide along with the user interface of the system. To navigate away from this slide please use the keys ’left’, ’right’, ’up’, or ’down’. Please do not use any other buttons and do not navigate back. Around the slide you are seeing you will be able to see which direction will take you to which next slide. Going ’left’ may take you to a text, bullet points, a visualization, or an inphographic/photographic slide. The order of which key will take you where will change throughout the presentation. Hence if left takes you to a text after the first slide, it may take you to a visualization lateron. Choose freely how to explore the content.

There will always be four different slides per topic within the presentation: a text, bullet points, a visualization, or an inphographic/photographic slide. Once you have moved to the next topic the previous slides will become inaccessible. The miniature previews have a colored box surrounding them: dark blue means the slide contains information about the same subtopic as the current slide, whereas cyan means the slide contains information about a new subtopic.

Please pay attention to the material in the presentation as you will be asked a few questions about the material in the end. Regardless of which choices you make within the presentation you will be able to pick up the necessary information."
