notes

- question 1:
        easy - explicit in slides: age
        medium - political affiliation - implicitly mention this (conservative & ukip) -> distracting
        hard - occupation - not mentioned

think about which ones are easy medium or hard

q2: visualization has 2 visualizations
\hspace*{1cm} $\square$ \hspace*{5mm}  1.286 USD\\ 
\hspace*{1cm} $\square$ \hspace*{5mm}  1.192 USD\\ -> mentioned elsewhere - middle
\hspace*{1cm} $\square$ \hspace*{5mm}  1.268 USD\\ -> numbers inverted hard
\hspace*{1cm} $\square$ \hspace*{5mm}  1.628 USD\\ -> numbers inverted easy


- Please make sure that all photographic stimuli do have a
photographic element. For example, the one in Set 5 can be seen as
visualization, and ones in Set 1 and Set 4 as text. Basically from the
thumbnail image, one should be able to see that they is at least one
photo (based on the viewers' perceptual "definition").


    - stock market
        - fall, stabilize - medium - misunderstanding 
        - fall, bounce back - true
        - fall, fall - hard
        - up, fall - easy



I've taken a modular approach -> extensibility


- how do I factor in the survey responses? Do I only count the responses of people that answered correctly?
    - if using photo how many do get it wrong etc. -> confounding effect may be high -> that's why we ask the second question. trying to control as much as possible. result analysis tricky
        - basic statistics: how many people for each representation
            - how many ppl get it wrong for each representation. -> question b allows to further scrutinize statistics.
            - eu citizens possibly more knowledgable
